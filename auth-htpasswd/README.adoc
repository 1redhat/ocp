= HTPasswd

Configure an HTPasswd identity provider, based on the https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/authentication/identity_providers/configuring-htpasswd-identity-provider.html[documentation]

CAUTION: This is for demo purposes only 

* Login into openshift using `oc login -u kubadmin -p ...`
* Execute the script below to configure httpasswd and add roles to the users.
----
./run.sh

Now you should have `user1` to `user5`, and `admin1` to `admin5` all with the password `1redhat` configured in the `htpasswd` provider

NOTE: the identity provider can also be added using the UI at Administration -> Cluster Settings, Global Configuration tab, click OAuth

----
htpasswd -b users.htpasswd user6 1redhat
